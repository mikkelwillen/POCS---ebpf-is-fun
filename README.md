# Writing eBPF Programs with High-level Libraries: A Comparison of Aya and fun eBPF
A Project Outside Project Scope (PCOS) by Caroline Kierkeaard and Mikkel Will√©n

## Abstract 
This paper presents a comparative study of two high-level frameworks for developing eBPF code: Aya, implemented in Rust, and fun eBPF, implemented in Haskell. We developed an experimental setup with a Rust-based server and client to replicate and extend previous throughput experiments originally performed with fun eBPF. Our investigation focused on evaluating performance differences, particularly the impact of filtering in kernel space versus user space, and assessing the usability of specific library features. In addition to throughput measurements, we conducted packet loss experiments to address a potential threat to the validity of our performance tests. The results indicate that, while the Haskell implementation shows minor differences in packet loss between filtering modes, the Rust-based system maintained practically no packet loss. Furthermore, our analysis highlights a difference between ease of use and control. Aya offers higher-level abstractions that simplify stack management and map operations, whereas fun eBPF provides more control over low-level operations. Overall, this work provides insights into the differences in developing eBPF programs with these two libraries and suggests directions for future experiments to further expand the comparative analysis.
