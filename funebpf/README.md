Fun eBPF
========

This directory contains a small setup for running eBPF experiments.

Contents
--------
This directory consists of 
- 'ebpf-linux-api' which contains an API for calling ebpf functions from linux.
- 'server-lib' which is a small server library in Haskell. This can be used for making experiments/examples of small eBPF programs, that affects the behavior of a small server instance.
  There is a README in this directory, describing how to use the examples.
- 'cabal.project' for letting you build and install the project.
